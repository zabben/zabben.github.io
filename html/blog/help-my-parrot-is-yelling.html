    <h1>Help! My parrot is yelling</h1>
    <p>
      If you have parrot, it's going to be loud. They usually yell twice a day; once in the morning
      and once in the evening. There are times though when a parrot yells more than that and this
      can have a wide variety of reasons. It can be related to their cage, food or health. The first
      thing to remember with parrots is this: keep it occupied and do not engage when it yells. An
      occupied parrot is less likely to yell than a bored one. Besides this, these are a couple of
      guidelines to keep in mind.</p>
    <h4>Cage</h4>
    <p>The parrots cage should be entertaining for them. Stuff it with branches for them to gnaw and climb
      on and with toys to play with. Don't keep the same toys in the cage for a long time: rotate.
      Some parrots are bored easily and need something new every once in a while. Don't overstuff
      though; like us humans, parrots like their breathing space as well.</p>
    <h4>Food</h4>
    <p>Concerning food, you can try to keep your parrot occupied by hiding food in specific toys or
      by changing its diet. They might just be hungry or don't like the food you are usually giving
      them, sometimes the solution is easier than the problem. The pet shop has many toys for
      parrots that you can stuff food in so the parrot can only get to it after some effort. This
      keeps them occupied and they get a reward.</p>
    <h4>Health</h4>
    <p>The parrot might yell because it is not feeling well. Check you parrot for unusual behavorial
      patterns or weight loss and don't hesitate to visit a doctor.</p>
    <h4>Training</h4>
    <p>Toys are not enough. You have to actively play with and train your bird. Learn them tricks,
      like stepping up (pretty basic) and flying around the room to land on a specific spot. Some parrots
      even like to shower with you. Spice up its live, keep it occupied!</p>
